Experimentally, we would accomplish this by deleting or disabling the gene that codes for the enzyme that catalyzes that reaction. Here, we can just add a constraint to the model that prohibits all solutions that place any flux through a particular reaction. This will force the flows to go across other reactions to get to BIOMASS, which may decrease (or increase) BIOMASS production.\n",
