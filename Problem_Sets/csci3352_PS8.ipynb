    "metabolic networks.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03288)\" *Nature* **433** (2005). The mathematical form of $P_i$ was chosen to that $P_i\\approx1$ if $i$'s connections are distributed evenly among the modules, and $P_i\\approx0$ if $i$'s connections are entirely to nodes in one module (typically its own). You can think of a node's \"participation\" as measuring how much it participates in *other* modules; hence, a low participation coefficient means *not* connecting to many other modules. It's defined as\n",
